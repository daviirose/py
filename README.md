# Python/FLask
Building a planner in Python/Flask

This project will consists off a pusher tutorial https://pusher.com/tutorials/todo-app-flask. Which is simply a todo list.

As an Admin User, I need to be able to register and login but most importantly keep my todo list privately,  As an Admin User, I would like to add/delete and also scratch off when a task is done. As an Admin User, I would like to make it use it on my mobile phone due to the fact that I wouldn't be home, I would be on the go. As an Admin User, I need to be able to create a new password with no issues regarding if I ever forget my password (Or simply create a new account).

Feature list: Once you sign up and login, you will be able to create a todo list and create multiple articles either summazring what you did throughout your day or simply write whatever you want. You will be able to edit and delete these article. You will be able to add and scratch off your list within your "todo" how ever you desire.
